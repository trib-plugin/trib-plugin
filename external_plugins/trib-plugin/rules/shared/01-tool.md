# Tool Use

First move — NARROW THE SCOPE before calling. A tool aimed at "the module responsible for X" finds it; a tool aimed at "X" returns noise.

## Batching — #1 iter saver

Every serial repeat of the same tool wastes a full turn. Use array / multi form FIRST:

- `recall` / `search` / `explore` → `query` as ARRAY; internal agent fans out in parallel.
- `read` → `path` as array for parallel multi-file read; `mode:'head'|'tail'|'count'` for peek / stats. NEVER serial `read`.
- `edit` → `edits` as array — same file applies sequentially, different files in parallel. Covers old `multi_edit` / `batch_edit` in one call. NEVER serial `edit`.
- `apply_patch` → prefer for non-trivial multi-file or large-context edits. One patch turn beats repeated `read` → `edit` loops.
- `grep` → `pattern` and/or `glob` as array (OR-joined).
- `glob` → `pattern` as array (OR-joined).
- `bash` → chain dependent commands with `&&` / `;` in ONE call. NEVER split dependent work.
- `list` → single call; switch `mode:'list'|'tree'|'find'` for the view.
- Independent calls on DIFFERENT tools with no data dependency — send in ONE message, not sequential turns.

## General Iter Budget

- Work in **2 rounds max per sub-problem** (locate → confirm). Repeated retrieval → ask what NEW information the next call adds; enough evidence → stop probing and move to the edit / answer.

## Routing

- Known path → `read` directly. Unknown location → `grep` / `glob` first, then targeted `read`.
- Code structure (imports, dependents, symbols, references, callers): `code_graph` before raw `grep`.
- Multi-file or already-clear edits: `apply_patch` before repeated `read` → `edit`.
- Shell work across turns: `bash_session` reuses shell state — don't replay setup in repeated `bash` calls.
- Large tool outputs may be saved to a path with a preview; only `read` that path if the preview is insufficient.

- Past context → `recall`. External web / URL / GitHub → `search`.
- Local filesystem → `explore` — one natural-language query fans glob + grep out in parallel; ideal for multi-angle questions ("how does X work, and where is it configured?") where several patterns need to land in one shot. Known path → `read` directly.
- Order when unsure: recall → search → explore → grep+read.

## Scope boundaries

- `recall` — past context only. Not codebase, not web.
- `search` — external / web only. Not codebase, not memory.
- `explore` — local filesystem only. Not web, not memory.
- Pick the right tool; no silent cross-scope fan-out.

## Stop-and-reroute

Tool returns empty / wrong after 2 tries → don't loop. Change approach or ask.
