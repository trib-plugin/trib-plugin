// installs land with the Pool B surface already populated enough to edit via
// the Config UI (instead of presenting "file not found" and forcing the user
// to disambiguate between "empty content" vs "missing path").
//
// Only plugin-owned paths under `<plugin-data>/` are seeded. User-owned
// surfaces — the bare CLAUDE.md outside the managed block, project repo
// files, etc. — are never touched.
//
// Every seed is a scaffold: a commented template with edit guidance, not
// real content. The user fills it in. `existsSync()` gates every write so
// a second boot never overwrites user edits.

This file is injected into every Bridge (Worker / Sub / Maintenance) system
prompt. Keep it to project-wide rules that every Pool B agent should honour.

Kept short because it lives inside the BP_2 cache block; long essays churn
the Anthropic prefix hash every time you edit them. The Config UI's General
tab edits this file directly.

Example:
  - Prefer clarity over cleverness.
  - Ask before touching production systems.
  - All code comments in English.
